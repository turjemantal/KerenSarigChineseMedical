# Keren Sarig — Chinese Medicine Clinic

A full-stack clinic management platform for Keren Sarig's Chinese Medicine practice. Clients can submit enquiries and book appointments online; practitioners manage everything through an admin dashboard. Appointment reminders are sent automatically via WhatsApp the morning before each visit.

## Features

### Client-Facing
- **Lead capture** — contact form sends enquiries directly to the admin dashboard
- **WhatsApp OTP login** — passwordless authentication via a one-time code sent to the client's phone
- **Appointment booking** — real-time slot availability check before confirming a booking
- **Client portal** — authenticated clients view and cancel their own upcoming appointments

### Admin
- **Dashboard** — accessible at `/manager`; protected by a password-issued admin JWT
- **Lead pipeline** — status lifecycle: `new → contacted → booked → closed`
- **Appointment management** — approve, update notes, or cancel with a single action
- **Automated reminders** — cron job fires at 09:00 every morning and sends WhatsApp reminders for the following day's appointments

### Backend Architecture
- **REST API** with a global `/api` prefix; all routes follow resource-oriented naming
- **Role-based auth** — client JWTs (30 d) and admin JWTs (12 h) carry distinct roles; `AdminAuthGuard` rejects non-admin tokens on all management routes
- **Rate limiting** — global 60 req/min per IP via `@nestjs/throttler`; OTP send capped at 5/min, OTP verify and admin login at 10/min
- **Event-driven side-effects** via a Manager layer — booking triggers a WhatsApp confirmation without coupling the controller to the messaging service
- **Scheduled tasks** — NestJS `@Cron` decorator drives the daily reminder job independently of the request lifecycle
- **Joi validation pipeline** — every incoming DTO is validated at the controller boundary before it reaches business logic
- **Startup env validation** — server refuses to start if required environment variables are missing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 22
- **npm** ≥ 10
- **MongoDB** running locally on port 27017 — or use Docker (see [Docker](#docker))

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/turjemantal/KerenSarigChineseMedical.git
cd KerenSarigChineseMedical
```

### 2. Configure the server

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `server/.env` and fill in the required values (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install
```

### 4. Start the development servers

**Terminal 1 — API server** (port 3001):

```bash
cd server
npm run start:dev
```

**Terminal 2 — React client** (port 5173):

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
Admin dashboard: [http://localhost:5173/manager](http://localhost:5173/manager)

---

## Environment Variables

All configuration is read at startup via `server/src/config/index.ts`. The server **will not start** if any required variable is missing. Copy the example and fill in the blanks:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_ENV` | **Yes** | `TEST` (skip WhatsApp) or `PROD` (send real messages) |
| `PORT` | No (default `3001`) | Port the NestJS server listens on |
| `CLIENT_URL` | **Yes** | CORS origin — e.g. `https://yourdomain.com` |
| `MONGODB_URI` | No (default local) | MongoDB connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | **Yes** | Secret used to sign client JWTs (use a long random string) |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | **Yes** | Password for the `/manager` admin dashboard |
| `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Yes in PROD | Meta system-user access token |
| `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` | Yes in PROD | WhatsApp Business phone number ID |
| `WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_LANGUAGE` | Yes in PROD | Template language code — e.g. `he` |
| `WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_OTP` | Yes in PROD | Approved template name for OTP messages |
| `WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_BOOKING_CONFIRMATION` | Yes in PROD | Approved template name for booking confirmations |
| `WHATSAPP_TEMPLATE_APPOINTMENT_REMINDER` | Yes in PROD | Approved template name for daily reminders |

> In `APP_ENV=TEST` mode the server logs WhatsApp messages to the console instead of sending them. All WhatsApp variables are optional in TEST mode and required in PROD mode — the Joi startup check enforces this.

## API Reference

Base URL: `http://localhost:3001/api`

Auth notation:
- **Client JWT** — `Authorization: Bearer <token>` issued by `POST /auth/verify-otp`
- **Admin JWT** — `Authorization: Bearer <token>` issued by `POST /auth/admin`

```

---

#### `GET /appointments/mine` — requires Client JWT

## Running Tests

Tests live in `server/tests/` and cover authentication, appointments, leads, clients, WhatsApp service, and input validation (96 tests total).

```bash
cd server

# Single run
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:cov
```

### Linting

```bash
cd server && npm run lint
cd client && npm run lint
```

---

## CI/CD

Every push and pull request triggers the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

| Job | Steps |
|---|---|
| **Server** | Install deps → Lint → Test → Build |
| **Client** | Install deps → Lint → Build |

Both jobs run in parallel on `ubuntu-latest` with **Node.js 22**.

---

## Docker

A `Makefile` wraps the common Docker Compose commands so you don't need to type them out:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `make rebuild` | Full rebuild and start — use after every `git pull` |
| `make rebuild-server` | Rebuild server only (faster when only backend changed) |
| `make rebuild-client` | Rebuild client only (faster when only frontend changed) |
| `make up` | Start all services without rebuilding |
| `make down` | Stop all services |
| `make restart` | Restart all services |
| `make logs` | Tail logs for all services |
| `make logs-server` | Tail server logs only |
| `make logs-client` | Tail client logs only |
| `make ps` | Show running containers |

| Service | Exposed port | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `mongo` | none (internal only) | MongoDB 7 with persistent named volume |
| `server` | 3001 (internal) | NestJS API |
| `client` | **80** | React app served via Nginx; proxies `/api/*` to server |

The client's Nginx configuration proxies all `/api/*` requests to the server container, so the browser always talks to a single origin on port 80.

Data is stored in a named Docker volume (`mongo_data`) and survives container restarts and `docker compose down`. Only `docker compose down -v` removes the volume — never run that in production.

---

## Deployment

The recommended setup is a single EC2 instance (e.g. `t3.small`) running Docker Compose.

```bash
# On the EC2 instance
git clone https://github.com/turjemantal/KerenSarigChineseMedical.git
cd KerenSarigChineseMedical
cp .env.example .env   # fill in production values
make rebuild
```

To redeploy after a code change:

```bash
git pull
make rebuild
```

### Production checklist

- [ ] `APP_ENV=PROD` in `.env`
- [ ] Strong random `JWT_SECRET` — `openssl rand -base64 32`
- [ ] Strong `ADMIN_PASSWORD` — `openssl rand -base64 16`
- [ ] `CLIENT_URL` set to your public domain
- [ ] WhatsApp templates approved in Meta Business Manager
- [ ] EC2 termination protection enabled (protects the MongoDB volume)
- [ ] Point your domain to the EC2 public IP and configure HTTPS (e.g. via Nginx + Certbot on the host, or a load balancer)
